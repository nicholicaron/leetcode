# leetcode

In this repo I'll attempt to solve 50+ of the "best practice questions" on Leetcode, as recommended by the Tech Interview Handbook (https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions).

I'm going to try to focus primarily on Rust, but I may attempt some problems in other languages as well. 

Wish me luck!
