## Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return *the `kth` smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.*

**Follow up**: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
